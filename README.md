# House-Price-Prediction
"In the 'House Price Prediction' project, we embarked on the task of creating a robust and accurate model for forecasting house prices using a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, specifically the Boston Housing dataset. This project not only served as a valuable learning experience but also demonstrated our proficiency in the field of machine learning and data analysis. Here are some key highlights:

Data Acquisition: We started by obtaining the Boston dataset from Kaggle, which contains various features such as location, room count, bedroom count, and more, all potentially influencing house prices.

Algorithm Selection: To tackle this regression problem effectively, we employed two powerful algorithms - Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting. This dual-approach allowed us to compare and contrast their performance, providing a deeper understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.

Data Preprocessing: A crucial step involved thorough data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables. This ensured that the models could work effectively with the dataset.

Model Training: We divided the dataset into training and testing sets, then proceeded to train the models using the training data. The iterative process of model training involved optimizing hyperparameters and fine-tuning to achieve the best possible predictions.

Evaluation and Validation: The models were rigorously evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to gauge their accuracy and predictive capabilities.

Results: Our project culminated in the development of accurate house price prediction models. We were able to provide insights into factors influencing house prices in the Boston area, which can be invaluable for both buyers and sellers in the real estate market.

This 'House Price Prediction' project showcases our proficiency in leveraging machine learning techniques for practical applications, demonstrating our ability to handle real-world datasets and deliver actionable insights.
